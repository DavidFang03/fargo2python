# fargo2python

Python 3.x program that post-processes the outputs of the original Fargo code, of the Dusty Fargo-ADSG code, and of the Fargo3d code. All these codes are hydrodynamical codes that model the evolution of a gas+dust protoplanetary disc with embedded planets.

Have a look at the keynote presentation 'fargo2python' in the repository to see what the code does and how it works. Enjoy!
